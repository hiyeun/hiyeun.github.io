## Overview

This project focuses on **Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) perception** for safety-critical autonomous systems, where conventional line-of-sight sensing is insufficient.

The goal is to enable robust perception of objects and environments that are **occluded, indirectly observable, or partially observable**, using principled multimodal fusion and physics-aware reasoning.

## Key Topics

- NLoS object detection and localization  
- Multimodal sensor fusion under occlusion  
- Reliability-aware and fail-operational perception  
- Physics-based reasoning for indirect sensing  

## Motivation

Real-world autonomous systems frequently encounter scenarios where direct sensing fails due to occlusion, clutter, or environmental constraints.  
This project aims to **extend perceptual awareness beyond visible regions**, enabling safer and more reliable autonomy.

## Ongoing Work

- NLoS-aware fusion architectures  
- Dataset construction for NLoS scenarios  
- Evaluation under sensor degradation and edge cases
