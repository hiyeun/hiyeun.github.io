I am a graduate researcher at **Seoul National University**, working on **multimodal perception for safety-critical autonomous systems**.

My research focuses on enabling robust and fail-operational perception under challenging conditions, including **non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios**, sensor degradation, and complex real-world environments. I am particularly interested in how heterogeneous sensing and principled fusion strategies can extend perceptual capabilities beyond the limits of single-modality systems.

My current interests include:
- Multimodal Sensor Fusion  
- NLoS Perception  
- Autonomous Systems  
- Robotics  
- Robot Intelligence

You can find my research outputs and updates through the links below.
